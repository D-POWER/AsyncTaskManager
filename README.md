# AsyncTaskManager
A simple asynchronous task manager written in C++ and uses Boost for multi-threading. Tasks are run concurrently using as many threads as available.

It is possible to pause/resume tasks, keep track of the overall execution progress, and perform certain actions when a task is started or has finished doing work.
